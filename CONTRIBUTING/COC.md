# Code of Conduct, Well Being and Moderation teams

Forgejo strives to be an inclusive project where everyone can participate in a safe environment. The **Well Being** team is doing its best to defuse tensions before they escalate and is available to answer all requests sent its way. When diplomacy fails, the **Moderation** team will be forced to act to put a stop to actions that are contrary to the [Code of Conduct](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/code-of-conduct).

## Well Being and Moderation teams

Temporary Well Being and Moderation teams [were appointed 10 November 2022](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/13).

The moderation team will rely on this [Code of Conduct](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/code-of-conduct) when diplomacy fails.

### Well Being

Their goal is to defuse tensions.

It has no power whatsover. The members are approved by the organization and trusted to:

- Read all communications to detect tensions between people before they escalate.
- Do their best to defuse tensions.

### Moderation

Their goal is to enforce the [Code of Conduct](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/code-of-conduct) when diplomacy fails.

It has the power to exclude people from a space.

Their decisions must be logical, fact based and transparent to the Forgejo community who trust them with this responsibility.
